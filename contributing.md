I'm hoping someone will adapt this to be usable by non-technical
users, so anyone can just paste the url of an ebook on sale into 
a web app and have it show up in ebookdeals.

Mutli threading.  If you want to post a few books, it takes up to 40
seconds between books, and it would be nice to get several at a time.
Needs much more of UI to gather the results.

The code to get the author is messy because different Amazon pages
mark the author differently.  Maybe python 3.10 structured pattern
matching would be a nicer way to deal with this multi-pass logic.
