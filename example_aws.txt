make a spot instance Ubunto 20.04, i used t3.micro
allocate an elastic ip  - 54.156.48.95
give it security group allowing ssh

connect to it and run:



sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade

python3 --version

# For me that gets 3.8.10

sudo apt install -y  python3.8-venv
sudo apt install -y python3-pip
sudo apt install -y firefox-geckodriver
python3 -m pip install pip -U
git clone https://github.com/upup1904/reddit_ebookdeals.git frugal
cd frugal
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python form_it.py  https://go.ereaderiq.com/us/s/1/B0722D6PCG

# if you installed a different linux you might need
# to edit form_it.py to look for geckodriver in a different location

For post_it, you have to set up an app for your reddit account,
that is just a formality which makes sure you're not running something
by mistake, I believe.

While logged in go to

https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
Give it any name you want.  Choose "script"
Give it any descript you want
For both urls, put in any url you want, e.g. https://reddit.commit
Click "create"
It will give you a "secret", and in small print under the app name,
a string of numbers and letters that is the "id"

Make a directory /secrets
and a file:
/secrets/einkcheap.dev

(einkcheap is the name of the account I use to post and it's hardcoded
in the script but  the filename is arbitrary and doesn't have any
effect)

the contents of the file:

```
[ebooks]
username = your_reddit_name_here
password = your_regular_reddit_passowrd
client_secret = 6TZfd4A-p0O0yy77_uWa1cZrd66INw
client_id= vJdomwyqJ8xb1w
```

The first scrpt writes out to /tmp/dealt.txt
and the second script posts that file, using the configurations
above, to /ebookdeals

The script file you can adapt if you want it, it is something
I use on my pc, that tries to warn if the script missed an element
